# Bits-And-Bobs
Random pieces of code that I found interesting to implement over time. These were more projects that piqued my interest at the time, and I felt strongly enough to program. See list of code below:

happy-prime.py:

My "current" fun project. Based off of reading about it on the Dr. Who wikis, I decided that finding a number of Happy Prime Numbers was worth making code for. So these programs find Happy Prime Numbers for you. The end goal is to give a number, n, and the program will find that number for you.

ishappy.py = determines if a number, n, is a Happy number.
isPrime.py = determiens if a number, n, is a Prime number.
